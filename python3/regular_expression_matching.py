        # We receive a string s, and a pattern p
        # s will always be lowercase english letters
        # p will always be lowercase english letters and ' . ', ' * ' chars

        # Return true if the String s follows the Pattern p, false if not
        
        # ToDo 
        # define function to determine if there's a match
        # Find a way to iterate either the string, the pattern or both if needed
        # Match the corresponding pattern char with the respective string char following
        # the . and * rules
        
        
        # Keep in mind
        # ' * ' char can be 0 or infinite number of the preceding letter
        # ' . ' char can be any letter
        
        # Matching logic?
        # check if pattern char it's a '.' or a letter
        # then check if the next char is ' * '
        # if not, current pattern char must be a 1 to 1 match with the string
        # if there's an '*', it must match current pattern char 0 o more times
        # an '*' works as a wildcard: ALWAYS RETURNS A TRUE MATCH
