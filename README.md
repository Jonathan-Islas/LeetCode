# LeetCode
Module: Together

Learning Objectives:  
-	An idea is worth nothing. It's all in the execution.
-	In software engineering, a programming language is a tool and can be learned very quickly.
-	Test Everything (Be curious about the how's and why's).
-	Moonshot thinking.
-	Software engineering is more about dealing with people than dealing with computers.
-	A rock-solid grasp of computer science fundamentals.
-	Knowledge of how to learn.  

Assignments:  
Individually, create a new repository called LeetCode in your personal's Encora Github account (Not in the organization, but using your Encora's email).
Teamwork: As a team, solve the following leet code problems with Python, Java, and TypeScript programming languages:  
-	Median of Two Sorted Arrays  
- 	LRU Cache  
-  	Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
-  	Regular Expression Matching  

Each team should create one Pull Request in their LeetCode repository for each Programming Language. Put each problem in a different file in the same PR. Example:    
  
TypeScript (folder)  
-	Problem1.js  
-	Problem2.js  
-	Problem3.js  
-	Problem4.js
  
Java (folder)  
-	Problem1.js  
-	Problem2.js  
-	Problem3.js  
-	Problem4.js
