# LeetCode
Module: Together

Learning Objectives
An idea is worth nothing. It's all in the execution.
In software engineering, a programming language is a tool and can be learned very quickly.
Test Everything (Be curious about the how's and why's).
Moonshot thinking.
Software engineering is more about dealing with people than dealing with computers.
A rock-solid grasp of computer science fundamentals.
Knowledge of how to learn.

Assignments
Individually, create a new repository called LeetCode in your personal's Encora Github account (Not in the organization, but using your Encora's email).
Teamwork: As a team, solve the following leet code problems with Python, Java, and TypeScript programming languages:
Median of Two Sorted Arrays
LRU Cache
Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Regular Expression Matching

Each team should create one Pull Request in their LeetCode repository for each Programming Language. Put each problem in a different file in the same PR. Example:
TypeScript (folder)	
	Problem1.js
	Problem2.js
	Problem3.js
	Problem4.js
Java (folder)
  Problem1.js
  Problem2.js
  Problem3.js
  Problem4.js
One Technical Log (see below for a Technical Log template) as a team with all the problems included. 
Each team should have at least 3 people.

Individual Work: Choose one of the following problems and solve it using the programming language that you feel most comfortable with.
Find maximum number of string of pairs
Number of unequal triplets in aray
Find the distinct difference array

Create a PR in your Github (with your Encora's email) with the solution.
Create a Technical Log for the problem in Word format.
